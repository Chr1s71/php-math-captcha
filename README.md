<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
This is a simple PHP script for creating images with simple mathematical questions (Math CAPTCHAs) to protect the forms of your website from spambots.
</p>


<h3>How to Use:</h3>
<p>
To use the script, you have create an image tag that references the captcha.png file inside your form, like this:

<pre>
&lt;img src="captcha.png" alt=""&gt;
</pre>

Also, inside your form you have to put a textbox to return the user’s answer to your php script that processes your form, like this:

<pre>
&lt;input type="text" name="captcha_ans"&gt;
</pre>

To verify the user’s answer, inside the script that processes your form, you have to check if his answer matches the session variable $_SESSION['math_captcha']:

<pre>
if ( !isset($_SESSION['math_captcha']) || empty($_SESSION['math_captcha']) ) {
	//the math captcha has not been generated
}
else if ( !isset($_POST['captcha_ans']) || empty($_POST['captcha_ans']) ) {
	//the user didn't answered the question
}
else {

	$math_captcha = $_SESSION['math_captcha'];
	unset($_SESSION['math_captcha']);
	
	if ( (int) trim($_POST['captcha_ans']) === $math_captcha ) {
		//the answer is right!
	}
	else {
		//the answer is wrong
	}
	
}
</pre>

Check out the test_form.php file for a working example.
